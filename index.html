            Zoro was the first crew member to be recruited by Luffy.
            Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style
            known as santoryu (three katana fighting style). This is achieved by using
            one katana in each hand and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting
            with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his bandana, normally

              In this game you destroy planets by clicking on them with your mouse.
              When starting the game the mouse cursor will be hidden, instead there's a 
              crosshair in the middle of the screen and when moving the mouse the background
              and the planets move while the crosshair stays in the middle of the screen.
              That way it creates the illusion of being able to look around in the game.

              or encountered in my own games. Of course you can also play chess against 
              a friend with it if you're traveling and didn't have space for a chessboard 
              and chess pieces. Another use could be for example, you're playing with 
              someone via chats, email or other types of messages, so you send and recive 
              the moves in written form like "e4, e5". In that case you can now replay the 
              moves in the virtual chessboard and take a look at, it instead of 
              having to visualize it in your head.
