            Computer science for me started off as a hobby at first, but soon enough 
            it became my passion. 
            First, I taught myself how computers, networks, and the World Wide Web work.
            I learned about all the different concepts, 
            like memory allocation, binary, network layers and many more.
            I then got into programming, learning different languages for various
            purposes. 
          </p>
          <p class="about-description">
            Once I felt my understanding of programming was good enough.
            I went on to learn and practice cybersecurity.
            In the beginning I focused my attention on being able to spot and 
            exploit powerful vulnerabilities. Later I also spent some time 
            with reverse engineering and cracking software.

              A game to train your aim and mouse skills.
            </p>
            <p class="work-project-description2">
              In this game, you destroy planets by clicking on them with the mouse. 
              When the game starts, a crosshair appears in the center of the screen, 
              and the mouse cursor is hidden. You move the crosshair by moving the mouse. 
              There's an option to toggle fullscreen mode by pressing the 'f' key. 
              The game generally has two modes. When the window is small and not 
              maximized, the planets are close to each other, requiring minimal 
              mouse movement to hit them. In fullscreen mode, the planets are 
              farther apart, requiring more mouse movement to hit them. You can 
              close the game by pressing the 'ESCAPE' key
            </p>

              A program / game that is intended to be the digital counterpart to 
              a physical wooden chessboard.

              I made this virtual chessboard to help me replay chess 
              positions from matches I've watched or games I've played. 
              It's also useful for playing chess with a friend, 
              especially in situations where a physical chessboard 
              isn't available, like when traveling. Another way to 
              use it is for playing chess remotely, such as through 
              chat or email, where moves are sent in written form 
              (e.g., 'e4, e5'). Instead of trying to visualize the 
              moves in your head, you can use the virtual chessboard 
              to replay and review them.

              A powerful fuzzer to discover vulnerabilities across all kinds of webservices.
            </p>
            <p class="work-project-description2">
              This fuzzer is run by executing a command in the terminal. The execution can 
              be customized for individual demands by adding flags to the command. Currently, 
              this fuzzer has two fuzzing modes. For the default option, you provide a 
              URL and a wordlist file. The fuzzer will then fuzz the wordlist at the 
              end of the URL. The second option is to specifically fuzz for backup files on webservers. 
              This option is available by adding the '-bf' flag. With the '-sD' and '-sI' 
              flags, the speed can be decreased or increased for lighter or heavier scans, 
              depending on the target's environment. You can also add the '-v' flag for extra 
              verbosity.

              commands: Write: Enter write mode to add items to the list.
              Delete: Enter delete mode to remove items. You can either specify the line number to delete or type clear to delete everything.
              Display: View the current list.
              Change: Switch to a different list file.

            </p>
            <p class="work-project-description2">
              I created this program to assist with AFK (Away From Keyboard) 
              farming in video games. In some games, like Minecraft, where 
              farming resources can be time-consuming, AFK farming is a useful 
              technique. This involves building a farm or finding a spot where 
              you can stand still without moving, and all you need to do is press 
              a key or mouse button repeatedly to gather resources. With this program, 
              you don't have to sit in front of the screen the entire time. Instead, 
              you can do other tasks, like eating or going out, while still 
              progressing in the game.
